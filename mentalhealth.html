                <h2>Lack of Holiday Spirit</h2>
                <p>If you're feeling down in the dumps this holidays, there are a few methods for cheering up. Firstly, remember that you do not have to force yourself to feel a certain way and that its okay to feel feelings other than joy. Secondly, you could surround yourself with friends, family, and people who you hold dear. Remember that alcohol, drugs, etc. will not help to alleviate the pain. Please do not participate in the abuse of these substances.</p>

                <h2>Suffering From Grief</h2>
                <p>Remember that you do not have to force yourself to celebrate during the holidays. You can use this time to consult friends, family, therapists, etc. for anything that may help you overcome your hardships. The most important part of coping with the loss of a loved one is talking to and finding help from those close with you.</p>

                <h2>Feeling Alone Or Isolated</h2>
                <p>During the holidays, it's easy to feel a sense of loneliness and isolation. To alleviate this feeling, you can partake in a number of different strategies. You could try calling via video on a weekly or even biweekly basis. If you don’t feel comfortable in social situations, you could also try reading, meditating, and keeping up in a journal. It’s also important to remember that to keep a positive mindset, you must also take care of yourself. You can do this by maintaining a diet, exercising, getting good sleep, etc.</p>

                <h3>Lack Of Sunlight</h3>
                <p>The Holiday Seasons mean less sunlight exposure throughout the day. Less exposure to natural light can in turn lead to increased signs of depression. To counter this, you could try to get as much sunlight as possible. If you work, try doing it near a window so that you can take in more sunlight. Even wearing/outfitting your house with warm, bright lights can improve your mood! However, around this time, seasonal affective disorder (a severe case of the winter blues) can also hit. If you feel hopeless, have suicidal thoughts, or changes in appetite and sleep patterns, talk to your doctor. Effective treatments for SAD include light therapy, talk therapy, and medication.</p>

                <h3>Stress Over Gift Giving</h3>
                <p>During the holidays, it can be extremely easy to become overwhelmed and stressed out over budgeting or the choosing of gifts. However, there are ways to get over this. For one, you can simply let people know that you are unable to purchase gifts for them this year. Another option is to gift personal gifts, such as homemade items or even poems/stories. You can even give the gift of helping out a neighbor, friend, or family member. Just remember, gifts are more than just items that you can buy at your local thrift store. They can be sentimental and meaningful, which is something you should consider when picking a gift during the holidays!</p>
