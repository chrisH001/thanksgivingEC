                <h3>Food Sorting And Packaging </h3>
                <p>During the holidays, many people aren't able to afford the luxuries most other people can. For example, many people may not be able to purchase all if any food items on Thanksgiving. As a result, many volunteer programs like the one shown above allow those who are less fortunate to have the opportunity to experience a high quality Thanksgiving meal.</p>

                <h3>Shopping Assistance</h3>
                <p> Even if families are able to afford groceries, many of them contain disabled, sickly, or old relatives, meaning they are unable to go out a shop for themselves. As a result, you can help out by volunteering to go out and shop for them! Grab a cart, head on down to your local grocery store, and help out a family this Thanksgiving!</p>
